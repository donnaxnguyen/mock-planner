### How It Works
* When the user opens the planner, a blank schedule will be shown
* The user will see the current date and time based on when the page was accessed
* The planner is divided by the hour
* There will be three color codes:
* Previous hours that has passed will be grey
* Current hour will be teal
* Future hours will be soft blue
* When the user clicks on each timeblock, they will be allowed to type in an event
* The user can save their event
* When the user refreshes their page, their event will still be saved
* When the user is finished, they can also clear their day
