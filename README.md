# Daily Schedule Planner
This is a daily planner created for the user to plan and save events by the hour

## Summary
HTML, CSS, Momentjs, and Javascript was used to create this application

### How It Works
* When the user opens the planner:
  * A blank schedule will be shown
* The user will see the current date and time based on when the page was accessed
  * The planner is divided by the hour
* There will be three color codes:
  * Previous hours that has passed will be grey
  * Current hour will be soft pink
  * Future hours will be soft purple
* When the user clicks on each timeblock
  * They will be allowed to type in an event
  * The user can save their event
* When the user refreshes their page
  * Their event will still be saved
* When the user is finished
  * They can "Reset" their planner

* A digital clock by hours, minutes, and seconds
* 1-hour intervals starting from 9:00 am - 5:00 pm
* A box for each hour, so the user can type their events in
* A save button for each hour, so the user can save their events
